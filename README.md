# parity-function

## 8-bit data set for the two-class classification problem of the parity function

The parity function is a generalization of the XOR function. It takes
N binary input values, coded as x ∈ {0, 1}<sup>N</sup> and returns 0 when having a even number of ones
in x and 1 when it contains an odd number of ones. More formally, f : {0, 1}<sup>N</sup> → {0, 1}, where the
solution of the discrete equation x · x = 2n + m : n ∈ ℕ, m ∈ {0, 1} decides the output of the function
f (x) = m.

The data set covers the 8-bit parity function, that is translated in a
data set of 256 instances obtained from the 2<sup>8</sup> possible combinations of the two values of every 8-bits
input.
